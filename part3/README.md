These tests are temporary until Mr. Uyar releases the real tests. Please also note that there could be mistakes.

Tests expect your code to be runnable as described in the PDF.

./part3 "ce rulez"

To pass the tests, you need to sort your result anagrams. After that you can output the results as such,

["cruz eel","cruz lee","eel cruz","lee cruz"]

or

"cruz eel"
"cruz lee"
"eel cruz"
"lee cruz"

Both should work (take note that outputs are sorted in lexicographic order).

If the result list is empty (no anagrams), this whould be printed instead.

"There are no anagrams."
