# BLG458E-2019-2020-Spring-Final-Tests
Tests for the final take-home exam in Functional Programming 2019-2020 Spring, as suggested by Turgut Uyar.

Please take note that all these tests are subjective, and shouldn't be considered reliable.
There could be mistakes and one could inject false tests to eliminate some of the competition right ? :) 

I will add more as I advance.

In Calico testing, given the limited Windows support, one could use the Windows Subsystem for Linux as an alternative
for virtual machines.

It allows you to install and use the linux terminal and libraries, inside a Windows environment. You still need to
install ghc and calico, with apt and pip, given that using windows executables would still give you the same error.
