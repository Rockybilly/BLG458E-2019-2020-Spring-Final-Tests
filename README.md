# BLG458E-2019-2020-Spring-Final-Tests
Tests for the final take-home exam in Functional Programming 2019-2020 Spring, as suggested by Turgut Uyar.

Please take note that all these tests are subjective, and shouldn't be considered reliable.
There could be mistakes and one could inject false tests to eliminate some of the competition right ? :) 

I will add more as I advance.
